Readme for Filament Detector

# General guidelines and informations
With the ERCF V1.1 release, I will be updating the filament sensor design. It will use a new system from @Tircown, that will be usable on :
- Regular AfterBurner
- Galileo Clockwork
- LGX on AfterBurner

Those will be released soon.

For now you'll find here the "old" Galileo Clockwork sensor.
