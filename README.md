# EnragedRabbitProject

Welcome to the Enraged Rabbit Project Github page!

This project aims to bring multimaterial capabilities to 3D printers using a single Direct Drive toolhead, similar to what the Prusa MMU2 does. While this project is mainly dedicated to be used on Voron V2s, the main components can also be used on any 3D printer that runs Klipper.

There are 4 components so far : 
 - **The carrot Feeder** : this is the main unit. The Carrot Feeder allows to use a high number of different filaments (tested up to 9 channels so far) and feed them, one at a time, into the printer toolhead.
 - **The Carrot Warehouse** : a spool-holder and buffer combo to help you deal with the filament management issue associated with multimaterial systems.
 - **The King's Seat** : a pellet-purge system to remove the need for a wipe-tower and make faster filament purges. This system is designed for Voron V2s only so far.
 - **The filament sensor** : a filament sensor system located below the bondtech gears of the Voron V2 toolhead, to check proper loading//unloading of filament. So far only the Galileo version is available.
 
 You'll find more informations about each of those components into their respective folders. Note that this is a work in progress !!
 
 Right now only the Carrot Warehouse and the Filament Detector for the Galileo clockwork toolhead are available.
 
 The Carrot Feeder STLs and config files should be available before the end of February (2021 :p).
 
 The (preliminary) BOM for each of those components can be found here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1djVxoKnByb41ifVy2JTfhXmdf9UYpnUYfhvcNyUDuLw/edit?usp=sharing.
