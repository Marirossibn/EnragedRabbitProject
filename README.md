# EnragedRabbitProject

Welcome to the Enraged Rabbit Project Github page!

This project aims to bring multimaterial capabilities to 3D printers using a single Direct Drive toolhead, similar to what the Prusa MMU2 does. While this project is mainly dedicated to be used on Voron V2s, the main components can also be used on any 3D printer that runs Klipper.

 You like this project? You want to support me and my work, help me bring new cool stuff to the community? Well you can tip me here :

There are 4 components so far : 
 - **The Carrot Feeder** : this is the main unit. The Carrot Feeder allows to use a high number of different filaments (tested up to 9 channels so far) and feed them, one at a time, into the printer toolhead. The Carrot Feeder gear motion system (i.e. what is used to push and pull the filament) uses part of the Voron Design M4 extruder (namely the whole 80T wheel and part of the motor support//tensionning system).

 - **The Carrot Warehouse** : a spool-holder and buffer combo to help you deal with the filament management issue associated with multimaterial systems.

 - **The King's Seat** : a pellet-purge system to remove the need for a wipe-tower and make faster filament purges. This system is designed for Voron V2s only so far.
 - **The filament sensor** : a filament sensor system located below the bondtech gears of the Voron V2 toolhead, to check proper loading//unloading of filament. So far only the Galileo version is available.
 
 You'll find more informations about each of those components into their respective folders. Note that this is a work in progress !!
 
 Only the King's Seat is yet to be released !
 
 The (preliminary) BOM for each of those components can be found here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1djVxoKnByb41ifVy2JTfhXmdf9UYpnUYfhvcNyUDuLw/edit?usp=sharing.
 
Thanks !!
