# LGX Mount with TL IR Sensor

This mount is with the TriangleLabs IR sensor, if you don't care about printing clear filament.
Next update i'll make the lever in there too.

The mount itself is tested, also better fit to the toolhead cooling ducts is added, just as the org AB had.
The TL sensor still needs testing for fitment and effectiveness.
