# Mounting Frame

Mounting frame for a 6x ERCF Setup - In case you do not have the otherwise necessary 2020 Extrusions at hand.

## Details

Important: The design assumes the two furthest apart lying mounting holes along the length being 198mm in distance ( center to center ) thus you ERCF being in spec.

Comes with a built in ERCF Easy-Brd mounting solution ( shamelessly stolen from the original Mount including the Print in Place Supports for it - I suggest importing it as a "part with mltiple parts" ). The rear end has an Electrical/Data Wiring passthrough with built in ZipTie mounting solution. The 6 holes in the Frame need to be popuated with the Voron typical M3 Threaded Inserts for the ERCF to be mounted to. Does not come with the 3D printed hooks in the Photo for attaching it to your 3D Printer.

## BOM

- About 75g of Filament using standard Voron print settings.
- 6x M3 Threaded Inserts
- 1x ZipTie ( or more depending on your cable management standards )
