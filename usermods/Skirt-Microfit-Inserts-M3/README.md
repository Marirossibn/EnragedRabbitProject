 An iteration on dvorak74's [excellent MicroFit inserts](https://github.com/alchemyEngine/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/usermods/Skirt-Microfit-Inserts), based around meteyou's fantastic [G-code button mod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/printer_mods/meteyou/gcode_buttons).

Tweaks:
-   Receptical housing sits deeper, does not protrude.
-   Securely retained by lip on the rear receptacle housing and an M3 bolt
-   Luchador flair

## Basic assembly:
1. Slot the insert in through the outside face of a skirt hexagon.
2. Secure the insert with a lock ring on the back face.
3. Slide Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 housing(s) through the back side of the inserts.
4. Secure with an M3 button head (ISO7380) screw (6-16 mm long) threaded into
    the plastic plastic.
